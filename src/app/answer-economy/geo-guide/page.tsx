A step-by-step framework for optimising your digital presence for AI search engines." readTime="12 min read">

      <p>If you&apos;ve read <em>The Answer Economy</em>, you understand the shift. This guide is about what to do next. No theory. No handwringing. Just a structured approach to making your business visible in the age of AI-synthesised answers.</p>

      <p>Generative Engine Optimisation is not a rebrand of SEO. It is a fundamentally different discipline with different signals, different metrics, and different winners. But it builds on SEO foundations – so if your traditional search presence is weak, fix that first. You cannot be cited by an AI that has never encountered your content.</p>

      <h2>The GEO maturity model</h2>

      <p>Before you start optimising, you need to know where you stand. We use a four-level maturity framework to assess readiness.</p>

      <p><strong>Level 1 – Invisible.</strong> Your organisation has no deliberate GEO strategy. AI search engines may or may not mention you, and you have no idea which. Most businesses are here. It is not a comfortable place to be, but it is an honest starting point.</p>

      <p><strong>Level 2 – Reactive.</strong> You have audited your AI visibility and know what the major engines say about you. You have begun restructuring content for AI consumption but lack a systematic approach. You are responding to the problem rather than leading.</p>

      <p><strong>Level 3 – Strategic.</strong> GEO is embedded in your content strategy. You publish with dual audiences in mind – human readers and AI retrieval systems. You track citation frequency, sentiment, and share of voice across engines. Your content architecture is designed for ingestion.</p>

      <p><strong>Level 4 – Transformative.</strong> You are shaping the conversation, not merely participating in it. Original research, proprietary data, and authoritative thought leadership mean AI engines actively prefer your content. You have licensing relationships or API integrations with AI platforms. You are the source, not the echo.</p>

      <h2>Step one – audit your AI visibility</h2>

      <p>This is the single most important thing you can do this week. It takes an hour and the results will either reassure you or terrify you. There is no middle ground.</p>

      <p>Run the same set of queries across five engines – ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews. Use queries your customers would actually ask. Not brand searches. Discovery queries. The kind of question someone asks when they don&apos;t yet know you exist.</p>

      <p>For each query, record three things. First, whether you are mentioned at all. Second, the sentiment – positive, neutral, negative, or absent. Third, who is mentioned instead. That competitor list is your real strategic intelligence.</p>

      <p>If you want to automate this, our <a href="/answer-economy/geo-audit">GEO Site Audit tool</a> runs a structured assessment and gives you an AI-readiness score.</p>

      <h2>Step two – restructure your content architecture</h2>

      <p>AI retrieval systems do not read your website the way humans do. They extract discrete chunks of information and assess each chunk for factual density, authority signals, and structural clarity. Your content needs to serve both audiences simultaneously.</p>

      <p><strong>Implement schema markup rigorously.</strong> FAQ schema, How-To schema, Organisation schema, Author schema. Every page should declare what it is, who wrote it, and what questions it answers. This is not optional. It is the machine-readable layer that makes your content ingestible.</p>

      <p><strong>Write fact-dense opening paragraphs.</strong> AI systems often extract the first 200 words of a page. If your opening is vague, inspirational, or keyword-stuffed, you have wasted your best real estate. Lead with the answer. State your position. Be quotable from sentence one.</p>

      <p><strong>Use clear hierarchical headings.</strong> H2s and H3s are not decorative. They are the structural skeleton that AI uses to navigate your content. Each heading should be a question or a clear topic statement. Each section should be self-contained enough to be extracted as a standalone snippet.</p>

      <p><strong>Name your authors. Show their credentials.</strong> E-E-A-T – Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness – is not a Google ranking signal alone. It is how AI systems assess whether your content deserves to be cited. Anonymous content is invisible content.</p>

      <h2>Step three – create content that AI engines want to cite</h2>

      <p>Not all content is created equal in the answer economy. AI engines have strong preferences, and understanding them is the difference between being cited and being ignored.</p>

      <p><strong>Original research is king.</strong> Proprietary data, unique analysis, and first-party studies see citation rates up to five times higher than derivative content. If you have data nobody else has, publish it. Structure it clearly. Make it easy to reference.</p>

      <p><strong>Freshness matters.</strong> AI citations skew 25% newer than traditional search results. A brilliant piece of analysis from 2022 is already fading from AI memory. Update your best content regularly. Add new data points. Refresh your conclusions. Timestamp everything.</p>

      <p><strong>Answer specific questions completely.</strong> The messy middle of the consumer journey – that profitable purgatory of comparison shopping – is being compressed into a single AI interaction. Your content needs to answer the full question, not just gesture at it. Comprehensive, authoritative, definitive.</p>

      <p><strong>Kill the filler.</strong> AI systems are surprisingly good at distinguishing substance from padding. Blog posts that stretch 300 words of insight across 2,000 words of SEO-optimised waffle will not be cited. Say what you mean. Support it with evidence. Stop.</p>

      <h2>Step four – optimise for each engine&apos;s quirks</h2>

      <p>The AI search landscape is not monolithic. Each engine has preferences worth understanding.</p>

      <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> favours fresh content and news outlets. It tends to cite recent publications and well-known brands. If you are publishing regularly and your domain has established authority, ChatGPT is your friendliest audience.</p>

      <p><strong>Perplexity</strong> genuflects before academic and institutional sources. It provides extensive citations and tends to favour depth over recency. If you publish research, white papers, or data-heavy analysis, Perplexity will find you.</p>

      <p><strong>Claude</strong> excels at multi-step reasoning and nuanced analysis. It tends to synthesise across multiple sources rather than citing one. Your content needs to be substantive enough to contribute to a synthesised answer, not just provide a soundbite.</p>

      <p><strong>Google AI Overviews</strong> lean heavily on existing search rankings but also show a surprising appetite for Reddit, Quora, and community-generated content. Strong traditional SEO remains essential here.</p>

      <p><strong>Gemini</strong> is tightly integrated with Google&apos;s knowledge graph. Structured data, Wikipedia presence, and consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information across the web all strengthen your visibility.</p>

      <h2>Step five – change what you measure</h2>

      <p>If you are still reporting on organic traffic, click-through rates, and keyword rankings as your primary KPIs, you are measuring the wrong things. Those metrics are not worthless – they still matter for traditional search – but they no longer capture the full picture of digital visibility.</p>

      <p><strong>Citation frequency.</strong> How often are you mentioned in AI-generated responses to relevant queries? This is your new equivalent of search ranking position.</p>

      <p><strong>Citation sentiment.</strong> When AI mentions you, is the context positive, neutral, or negative? Being cited in a list of cautionary examples is worse than not being cited at all.</p>

      <p><strong>Share of voice.</strong> Across your category, what proportion of AI-generated answers include your brand versus competitors? This is the competitive metric that matters most.</p>

      <p><strong>Source attribution.</strong> When AI engines cite their sources, are they linking to your content directly? Or are they citing a secondary source that referenced you? Direct attribution is stronger and more durable.</p>

      <h2>The 90-day implementation plan</h2>

      <p><strong>Weeks 1–2.</strong> Conduct the AI visibility audit. Map your current state across all five engines. Identify the gaps. Build your competitor citation map. This is your baseline.</p>

      <p><strong>Weeks 3–4.</strong> Implement technical foundations. Schema markup across your site. Author pages with credentials. FAQ sections on key pages. Fix any crawlability issues that might prevent AI systems from accessing your content.</p>

      <p><strong>Weeks 5–8.</strong> Content restructuring. Rewrite your top twenty pages with GEO principles. Lead with answers. Increase factual density. Add structured data. Publish at least one piece of original research or proprietary analysis.</p>

      <p><strong>Weeks 9–12.</strong> Measurement and iteration. Run the AI visibility audit again. Compare against baseline. Identify what moved and what didn&apos;t. Double down on what works. GEO results typically manifest in 3–6 months, faster than traditional SEO.</p>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>

      <p><strong>Don&apos;t abandon SEO.</strong> GEO builds on SEO foundations. A site that is invisible to Google&apos;s crawler will also be invisible to AI retrieval systems. You need both.</p>

      <p><strong>Don&apos;t use AI to create AI-optimised content.</strong> The irony is painful but real. AI-generated content optimised for AI consumption tends to be generic, derivative, and indistinguishable from thousands of other AI-generated pages. Original thinking, human expertise, and genuine authority are what AI engines want to cite.</p>

      <p><strong>Don&apos;t optimise for one engine.</strong> The AI search landscape is fragmenting rapidly. A strategy built entirely around ChatGPT will miss Perplexity&apos;s growing audience. Diversify your approach.</p>

      <p><strong>Don&apos;t wait.</strong> The ROI timeline for GEO is short – 3–6 months for measurable results. Every month you delay is a month your competitors are building citation authority that compounds over time. In the answer economy, first-mover advantage is real and durable.</p>
