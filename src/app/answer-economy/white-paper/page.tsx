      <p>The digital marketing landscape is witnessing its most profound transformation since the advent of the search engine itself. We are shifting from a search economy – where users sift through links – to an answer economy, where AI delivers synthesised solutions directly.</p>

      <p>This is not a trend to monitor. It is a transformation to lead.</p>

      <h2>The shift from search to resolution</h2>

      <p>Content placeholder. This white paper merges four overlapping source documents into one definitive narrative: the original Answer Economy white paper, the short explainer, the SEO-to-GEO article, and the &ldquo;Your Customers Aren&apos;t Searching&rdquo; LinkedIn piece.</p>

      <blockquote>The brands that thrive in this new landscape won&apos;t be those that mourn the loss of traditional SEO metrics. They&apos;ll be those that understand that being the answer is infinitely more valuable than being a link.</blockquote>

      <h2>Generative engine optimisation</h2>

      <p>Placeholder for the GEO methodology section. This will cover E-E-A-T principles, structured data implementation, content architecture for AI crawlers, and the maturity model.</p>

      <h2>Winners, losers, and the walking dead</h2>

      <p>Placeholder for the sector-by-sector analysis. Publishing, B2B services, e-commerce, healthcare – each facing different implications from the Answer Economy shift.</p>

      <h2>What to do about it</h2>

      <p>Placeholder for the practical implementation framework. Links through to the GEO Practical Guide for detailed action steps.</p>
