      <p>Here is a thought experiment. Take everything a mid-sized enterprise does and ask a simple question of each activity: could a well-equipped individual, or a small team of three, do this faster, cheaper, and better with generative AI?</p>

      <p>The honest answer, for a discomfiting number of activities, is yes.</p>

      <p>Not all of them. Not yet. But enough to make you wonder whether the traditional enterprise – with its layers of management, its quarterly planning cycles, its compliance infrastructure, its HR department, its intranet nobody reads – is becoming a liability rather than an asset.</p>

      <h2>The overhead problem</h2>

      <p>Large organisations are expensive to run. Not because of what they produce, but because of what they consume in the act of producing it. Coordination costs. Approval chains. Internal communications. Status meetings about status meetings. A significant proportion of enterprise activity exists to service the organisation itself rather than its customers.</p>

      <p>Generative AI does not have this problem. It does not need to be briefed. It does not take holidays. It does not require a performance review. It does not send passive-aggressive emails about car parking.</p>

      <p>The enterprise was built for a world where information was scarce and coordination was hard. Hierarchy solved the information flow problem. Process solved the coordination problem. But we no longer live in that world. Information is abundant and AI handles coordination beautifully. The infrastructure that once provided competitive advantage now provides competitive drag.</p>

      <h2>The individual as the new atomic unit</h2>

      <p>Something remarkable is happening at the edges of the economy. Individuals – armed with Claude, GPT-4, Midjourney, Cursor, and a laptop – are producing work that would have required a team of ten five years ago.</p>

      <p>A single person can now build a functioning SaaS product in a weekend. Write, design, and publish a professional white paper in a day. Create a brand identity, marketing strategy, and launch campaign without hiring an agency. The tools have not just lowered the barriers to entry. They have demolished them.</p>

      <p>This is not a niche phenomenon. It is a structural shift in the economics of production. The minimum viable team for an increasing range of activities is converging on one.</p>

      <p>The implications for enterprises are severe. If your value proposition depends on assembling large teams of specialists, and those specialists can now operate independently at comparable quality, what exactly are you selling? Coordination? Overhead? A logo on the proposal?</p>

      <h2>Fluid talent and the transient organisation</h2>

      <p>The replacement model is already emerging. Call it fluid talent, the gig economy 2.0, or the transient organisation – the labels matter less than the structure.</p>

      <p>The pattern works like this. A small core team – perhaps three to five people – holds the client relationship, the strategic vision, and the institutional knowledge. Around that core orbits a constellation of specialists, engaged project by project, week by week, sometimes day by day. AI handles the connective tissue – the briefing, the coordination, the quality assurance, the first drafts that used to consume half the project timeline.</p>

      <p>This model is not hypothetical. It is how the most sophisticated boutique consultancies, creative studios, and technology firms already operate. They carry minimal fixed costs, scale instantly for large projects, and maintain quality through tight curation of their talent network rather than through employment contracts and HR policies.</p>

      <p>The economics are brutal for incumbents. A fluid organisation with five permanent staff and a curated network of fifty specialists can match the output of a traditional firm with fifty permanent employees – at a fraction of the cost, with none of the overhead, and with the ability to reconfigure its capabilities overnight.</p>

      <h2>What enterprises get wrong about AI adoption</h2>

      <p>The standard enterprise response to generative AI is revealing in its timidity. Form a committee. Commission a report. Run a pilot. Announce an AI strategy. Buy some licenses. Wait for the vendors to deliver something turnkey.</p>

      <p>This is not wrong, exactly. But it is catastrophically slow. By the time most enterprises have completed their AI readiness assessment, the fluid competitors have already shipped three products and stolen two clients.</p>

      <p>The deeper problem is cultural. AI is not an IT project. It is a behavioural change project. Deploying the technology without changing the workflows, the incentives, the decision-making structures, and the cultural norms around how work gets done is like buying a Formula One car and driving it in second gear.</p>

      <p>The organisations that treat AI as a cost-reduction tool – make the same processes faster and cheaper – are missing the point entirely. The opportunity is not to do the same things more efficiently. It is to do fundamentally different things. Things that were not economically viable when they required large teams and long timelines.</p>

      <h2>The survival playbook</h2>

      <p>This is not a eulogy for the enterprise. Large organisations have genuine advantages – brand equity, client relationships, regulatory expertise, capital access – that fluid competitors cannot easily replicate. But those advantages erode quickly when the underlying economics shift.</p>

      <p>The enterprises that survive will share certain characteristics.</p>

      <p><strong>They will be radically lean.</strong> Not through layoffs, but through genuine restructuring of how work is organised. Fewer layers. Fewer approvals. Fewer activities that exist to service the organisation rather than the customer. AI handles the coordination; humans handle the judgment.</p>

      <p><strong>They will build, not just buy.</strong> Off-the-shelf AI tools deliver commodity capability. Competitive advantage comes from proprietary applications built on your specific data, your specific workflows, your specific domain expertise. The firms that treat AI as a platform for building – not just a product for consuming – will pull ahead.</p>

      <p><strong>They will embrace hybrid models.</strong> The future is not pure enterprise or pure fluid talent. It is a deliberate blend – a permanent core that holds relationships and institutional knowledge, surrounded by a curated network that provides specialist capability on demand. Getting this balance right is the strategic challenge of the decade.</p>

      <p><strong>They will move at startup speed.</strong> The quarterly planning cycle is a luxury that AI-era competition does not permit. The enterprises that survive will adopt continuous planning, rapid experimentation, and a tolerance for imperfection that would horrify their current compliance departments.</p>

      <h2>The uncomfortable question</h2>

      <p>So will the enterprise survive? Yes – but not in its current form. The organisations that thrive will be unrecognisable compared to their 2020 selves. Smaller permanent headcounts. Larger networks. Flatter structures. Faster cycles. More technology, less bureaucracy.</p>

      <p>The ones that cling to the old model – the layers, the processes, the committees, the twelve-month planning horizons – will discover that the market has moved on without them. Not with a dramatic collapse, but with a slow erosion of relevance as clients find that three people with AI can do what fifty people without it used to do.</p>

      <p>The window for transformation is open. It will not stay open indefinitely.</p>
