      <p>Placeholder content. This article draws on the LinkedIn draft, the HFT/Michael Lewis analogy, and the agency valuation webinar analysis. It argues that there is a shrinking window of technological arbitrage between early AI adopters and everyone else – much like the advantage that high-frequency traders once enjoyed over traditional market participants.</p>
      <h2>The high-frequency trading parallel</h2>
      <p>Placeholder for the HFT analogy. Companies literally digging through mountains to shave nanoseconds off transactions. The same dynamic is playing out with AI adoption – except the stakes are higher and the window is narrower.</p>
      <h2>What the smart money is doing</h2>
      <p>Placeholder for the evidence of early-mover advantage in AI adoption across professional services.</p>
      <h2>The window is closing</h2>
      <p>Placeholder for the urgency argument and call to action.</p>
