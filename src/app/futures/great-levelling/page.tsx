      <p>For decades, competitive strategy has been a moat-building exercise. Accumulate scale. Hoard proprietary data. Cultivate specialist knowledge that takes years to acquire. Build barriers so high that competitors cannot clear them.</p>

      <p>Generative AI is draining every one of these moats simultaneously.</p>

      <h2>Your moat is already dry</h2>

      <p>Consider what AI does to the three classic sources of competitive advantage.</p>

      <p><strong>Scale.</strong> The traditional logic was simple – bigger is better because bigger means more data, more reach, more bargaining power, more capacity to absorb the fixed costs of doing business. But AI compresses the relationship between scale and output. A solo operator with the right tools can now produce work that once required a department. The marginal cost of the next unit of intellectual output is approaching zero. Scale advantages in knowledge work are evaporating.</p>

      <p><strong>Proprietary data.</strong> This was supposed to be the durable moat. Your data was unique. Your insights were derived from datasets nobody else possessed. But AI models are trained on the entirety of human knowledge. They can synthesise, extrapolate, and approximate your proprietary insights with alarming accuracy. Your data advantage has not disappeared – but it has narrowed dramatically.</p>

      <p><strong>Specialist knowledge.</strong> The professional services model has always rested on expertise that takes years to acquire. Lawyers, accountants, consultants, analysts – all charging premium rates for knowledge that clients could not access elsewhere. AI does not replicate this expertise perfectly, but it replicates it well enough for an expanding range of use cases. The question is no longer whether AI can do what your specialists do. It is how long before clients decide that &quot;good enough&quot; is good enough.</p>

      <h2>The capability plateau</h2>

      <p>There is a phenomenon emerging that deserves a name. Call it the capability plateau. As AI tools become universally accessible, the baseline capability of every organisation converges upward. The floor rises. Everyone can produce decent content, decent analysis, decent design, decent code.</p>

      <p>This sounds like progress – and it is. But it creates a strategic problem. When everyone can do everything to an acceptable standard, doing things to an acceptable standard is no longer a differentiator. The competitive question shifts from &quot;can you do this?&quot; to &quot;why should anyone choose you to do it?&quot;</p>

      <p>This is the great levelling. Not a race to the bottom on price – though that is happening too – but a convergence on capability that strips away the traditional markers of competitive distinction.</p>

      <h2>What replaces the old moats</h2>

      <p>If scale, data, and specialist knowledge no longer provide durable advantage, what does? The answer is uncomfortable for organisations that have spent decades building exactly those assets. The new moats are softer, harder to measure, and impossible to buy off the shelf.</p>

      <p><strong>Stakeholder trust.</strong> In a world where AI can generate plausible content on any topic, trust becomes the scarce resource. Not brand awareness – that is easy to manufacture. Genuine trust built on a track record of reliability, transparency, and demonstrated expertise. Trust that is earned over years and cannot be replicated by a well-prompted chatbot.</p>

      <p><strong>Cultural intelligence.</strong> AI is trained on averages. It knows what most people think in most situations. But business operates at the margins – the specific cultural context of a particular organisation, industry, or geography that makes the difference between advice that works and advice that sounds good. This kind of intelligence is experiential, contextual, and deeply human.</p>

      <p><strong>Speed of adaptation.</strong> When the tools are the same for everyone, competitive advantage accrues to those who adopt fastest, experiment most, and iterate quickest. This is fundamentally a cultural capability, not a technological one. The organisations that win are not those with the best AI tools but those with the lowest internal resistance to change.</p>

      <p><strong>The quality of questions.</strong> AI is extraordinary at generating answers. It is mediocre at generating questions. The ability to identify the right problem, frame it precisely, and ask the question nobody else is asking – this is the meta-skill that separates the leaders from the followers in an AI-levelled landscape. Curiosity, it turns out, is a competitive advantage.</p>

      <p><strong>Relationships.</strong> The most underrated moat of all. AI cannot have lunch with your client. It cannot read the room in a tense boardroom. It cannot build the kind of personal rapport that makes a client call you first when something goes wrong. In a world of infinite AI-generated capability, the human connection becomes more valuable, not less.</p>

      <h2>The recalibration of distinctiveness</h2>

      <p>The strategic imperative is clear. If your competitive advantage depends on doing things that AI can now do, you need to find a different source of advantage. Urgently.</p>

      <p>This is not about abandoning your core capabilities. It is about reframing them. The law firm that competes on speed of document review will lose to AI. The law firm that competes on the quality of its strategic counsel – informed by AI-assisted research but delivered with human judgment – will thrive. The consultancy that sells PowerPoint decks will be commoditised. The consultancy that sells trusted relationships and genuine insight will be more valuable than ever.</p>

      <p>The great levelling is not the end of competition. It is the beginning of a different kind of competition – one where the advantage goes to those who are most distinctly, irreplaceably human.</p>

      <p>Which raises an interesting question. In your organisation, do you actually know what that is?</p>
