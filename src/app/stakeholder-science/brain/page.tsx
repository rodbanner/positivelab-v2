      <p>Placeholder content. This is a radical condensation of the 25,000-word technical specification into a 1,000-word vision piece. It tells the story of what PCG BRAIN is, what problem it solves, and why it matters – in plain language, not technical jargon.</p>

      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>Placeholder for the core insight: stakeholder intelligence is fragmented across systems, teams, and operating companies. Critical signals are missed. Relationships are managed episodically rather than continuously.</p>

      <h2>The platform</h2>
      <p>Placeholder for the platform description. Real-time stakeholder sentiment analysis, predictive behaviour modelling, crisis anticipation, network mapping, competitive benchmarking – all feeding a single, unified view.</p>

      <h2>The architecture</h2>
      <p>Placeholder for a simplified version of the architecture diagram. The BRAIN sits at the centre of PCG&apos;s three operating companies, synthesising intelligence from Black Sun, People Made, and Stratton Craig into a coherent whole.</p>
